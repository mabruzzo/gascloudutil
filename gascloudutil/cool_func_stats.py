    Find the "special points" for some cooling curve.

    In more detail, these points correspond to the location where:
      - gas is in thermal equilibrium. In other words, heating/cooling has no
        effect (heating cancels out cooling).
      - local and global minima and maxima of the cooling time, `tcool`.
        Note that `tcool = eint_dens / ((d/dt) eint_dens)`, where `eint_dens`
        is the internal energy density (aka thermal energy density).

    The function searches for these "special" points along a 1D "curve" through
    phase space. For now, phase space is simply parameterized by mass-density
    and specific thermal energy. In the future, one could imagine parameterizing
    phase-space in terms of additional quantities such as metallicity or
    some description of background heating (e.g. how self-sheilded the gas is).

    This "curve" is specified by the `parametric_curve` argument, which maps
    the parameter ``s`` to coordinates in this phase-space along this "curve".
    More details are provided below. This "curve" is usually an isobar.

    Parameters
    ----------
    parametric_curve: callable
        This is a callable accepting a single argument `s`. It represents a
        1D curve through phase space. In more detail:
          - this callable should return a tuple of 2 floats. The first entry
            is treated as the mass-density. The second entry is the specific
            internal energy. Both are implicitly assumed to have cgs units
            (so "g/cm**3" and "cm**2/s**2", respectively)
          - Both mass-density and specific-internal-energy should be continuous
            functions of `s`. In particular, specific-internal-energy should be
            monotonically non-decreasing function of `s`.
          - This "curve" is usually an isobar and `s` is commonly just the
            specific internal energy.
    s_bounds : tuple of 2 floats
        The minimum and maximum values `s` that can be passed to 
        `parametric_curve`.
    brute_step : float
        The step-size of s (to use for the initial brute-force search)
    is_log10_brute_step: bool
        Whether `brute_step` is specified in linear or logarithmic space
    cooling_curve
        This represents the cooling function. It must have a function called
        calculated_tcool, that expects each function returned by a call to
        `parametric_curve` to be forwarded on, in the same order.
    maxiter_each: int
        The maximum number of iterations used in each rootfinding call and each 
        call to identify extrema locations
    s_rel_tol : float
        The relative tolerance used to dictate when each rootfinding/extrema 
        finding call terminates.


    Returns
    -------
    heat_cool_intervals : HeatCoolIntervals
        object representing the heating and cooling intervals
    critical_s_vals: np.ndarray
        sorted 1D array specifying locations along the curve where extrema
        may occur

    Notes
    -----
    Currently we use a fairly exhaustive approach. In principle we don't need
    to be so exhaustive.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pthermal_div_gm1 : float
        The thermal pressure divided by the `(gamma - 1)`. As the specific
        thermal energy is varied, this is held constant
    eint_bounds : float
        The bounds of the specific internal energy (aka thermal energy). This 
        should be specified in cgs units (i.e. cm**2/s**2)
    brute_step: float
        Specifies the step-size to use to vary the specific internal energy
        while doing a brute force search to try to bracket the roots and the
        extrema
    is_log10_brute_step : bool
        Specifies whether brute_step is in log-space or linear space. In the 
        latter case, then `brute_step` should have cgs units
    cooling_eos
        An eos object is used to compute the cooling time.
